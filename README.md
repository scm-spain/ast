# AppNexus Seller Tag
The AppNexus Seller Tag (AST) is a lightweight JavaScript SDK that runs in the header or body of a web page in a user's browser and allows publishers to conduct auctions directly from the page. AST consolidates all ad slots on a page to be auctioned and sends information about them in a single ad request whenever possible. AST loads asynchronously, meaning that ad calls do not block the page content from loading.

## Introduction

Schibsted spain is not the owner of this library, this is only a wrapper to be able to push it to npm package manager until AppNexus decide to do it by their self.

## How to use it

import it with require 

```
require('@schibstedspain/ast')
```

Current version of the AST in use is 0.9.0, last stable release.
