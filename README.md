# ast
The AppNexus Seller Tag (AST) is a lightweight JavaScript SDK that runs in the header or body of a web page in a user's browser and allows publishers to conduct auctions directly from the page. AST consolidates all ad slots on a page to be auctioned and sends information about them in a single ad request whenever possible. AST loads asynchronously, meaning that ad calls do not block the page content from loading.
